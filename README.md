# Practical Data Science on the AWS Cloud Specialization
<hr>

This repository covers the course lab material I completed in the Cloud Specialization offered by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/practical-data-science">AWS on Coursera</a>.
The Specialization is divided into three major categories/courses:
- Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML
- Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines using BERT
- Optimize ML Models and Deploy Human-in-the-Loop Pipelines

Overall specialization provided a comprehensive understanding of Cloud concepts required for Data Science projects, along with assessments for hands-on experience.
